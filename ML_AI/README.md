### Topic modeling of arxiv scientific publications 
#### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
This is an independent project that I took upon for fun. The goal of this project is to use the open publications on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) to build a recommender system for a query document. 

### Disclaimer
The model was created as an independent fun project. Feel free to use it at your own risk.
